# Bachelor Thesis: Nested Sampling

- Old code from 2020 used for my Bachelor thesis.
- The Fortran programs generate the data, while the Mathematica (nb) or Python code plot them.
- Some Python code repeats the result using the dynasty library. This is done for comparison.
- MH folders explore the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, while NS folders explore the Nested Sampling algorithm.
